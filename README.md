Code I wrote for a /r/dailyprogrammer submission that can be found here: http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2peac9/20141215_challenge_193_easy_a_cube_ball_cylinder/

This is a console application and uses user input of a volume to determine the dimensions of a cube, a cylinder, a cone, and a sphere with some assumed values for the cylinder and the cone.
